# Anisotropy is Not Inherent to Transformers

A repository to go along with the NA ACL 2024 paper (https://openreview.net/forum?id=xulEgHJiLs&noteId=xulEgHJiLs)

## graphs/svd reducation

2D SVD reduction graphs for all models examined in the paper. You can even seen how the grouping changes during trianing.

## src/

Currently just two files. One to reproduce the partition function results and a demo file to see how our faster cosine method works.

Will probabily add more here, but if there's anything you'd like me to focus on let me know!
